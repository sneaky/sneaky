ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m sneaky or you may know me as Sean

Currently working in IT, but I love computer science and math so I've been spending some of my free time building small projects.

Always interested in learning new things and would love to grow my network more in the software side of things, so feel free to reach out if you'd ever like to work together on something.

How to reach me ... sneak.dev@pm.me
